# TypingTest

Typing test that I created. There is still a bug with the timer, where it begins before the first letter is typed. 
However the basic concept is still functional and I was able to demonstrate basic Js, HTML, and CSS skills. 

Random quotes are generated that the user attempts to type out in a short time. After the quote is typed out and
verified as correct the user typing score is displayed in words per minute at the bottom of the screen. If the user presses
the restart button at any time the clock will be reset and a new quote will be generated.
