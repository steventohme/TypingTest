# TypingTest

Typing test creating using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. 

Random quotes are generated that the user attempts to type out in a short time. After the quote is typed out and
verified as correct the user typing score is displayed in words per minute at the bottom of the screen. If the user presses
the restart button at any time the clock will be reset and a new quote will be generated.
